Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Apporach is one of the most popular books among Econometricians and Economists to learn the conepts and intuitions behind Data algorithms, however, the exercises are implemented in R language, which is a hinderence for all those who are using python language. To overcome this i have tried solving all the questions in practical exerices in Python language. Along with that I have also provided the solutions for conceptual questions. I have commented the notebooks. If you find any query, do send a feedback about the same. Suggestions and corrections are welcome.
